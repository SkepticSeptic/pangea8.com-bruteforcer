# pangea8.com-bruteforcer

What is pangea8? Why does it need to be bruteforced?
Find out why and follow progress here: weirdbug.x10.bz

WARNING: This was tested on a linux based system (pop!_os) in order to 
later be lightweight enough to run on 4-5ish VM's on a single PC.
No guarantees this will work on Windows, although it is likely to with a few tweaks, 
which should be easy enough with my fabulous comments.


WHAT YOU NEED:

Python3
Pyautogui (python library)
Pip (to install Pyautogui)
